# Analyzing extracted data with PowerBI
Objective: Now that we projected information to the Knowledge Store, this structured data could be useful in scenarios that go beyond Search. In this module weâ€™ll connect the table projections we created to PowerBI and create a few sample graphs with the extracted data.

1.	Run PowerBI desktop and click **Get Data**.

6.	For Documents:
+ Remove the **PartitionKey, RowKey, and Timestamp** columns created by Azure Table storage. Knowledge store provides relationships used in this analysis.
+ Expand the **content** column.
