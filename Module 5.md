# Analyzing extracted data with PowerBI
Objective: Now that we projected information to the Knowledge Store, this structured data could be useful in scenarios that go beyond Search. In this module weâ€™ll connect the table projections we created to PowerBI and create a few sample graphs with the extracted data.

1.	Run PowerBI desktop and click **Get Data**.
 
2.	Select **Azure Table Storage**
 
3.	When prompted, enter the key to your storage account.

4.	Select the 3 tables we just produced:
 
5.	Open **Power Query** by clicking the **Edit Queries** command.
 
6.	For Documents:
+ Remove the **PartitionKey, RowKey, and Timestamp** columns created by Azure Table storage. Knowledge store provides relationships used in this analysis.
+ Expand the **content** column.
 
7.	Change the relationships so they are bidirectional
